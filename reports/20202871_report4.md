AIRBNB PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING AND SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

The article “Airbnb Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Sentiment Analysis” seeks to analyze the complexity of determining the rental price on Airbnb, which has repercussions for both owners, who seek to maximize their income, and customers, who want an optimal valuation of the property. In this context, the objective of this paper is to develop a reliable price prediction model using machine learning, deep learning and natural language processing techniques to help both owners and customers. To achieve this purpose, the research question focuses on how to optimally anticipate rental prices on Airbnb by considering properties, owners, and customer reviews.

As for the strengths of the paper, the use of advanced techniques from linear regression to tree-based models, support vector regression (SVR), k-means clustering (KMC) and neural networks (NN) to create the prediction model is highlighted. In addition, the inclusion of sentiment analysis of customer reviews adds a valuable dimension to the model, as user opinions can have a considerable impact on the perceived value of a property. However, weaknesses in the approach are also identified, such as the reliance on a dataset that may not be representative of all cities or property types on Airbnb could limit the generalizability of the results. Likewise, the complexity of the model could hinder its practical implementation for owners seeking to set prices intuitively.

This paper advances knowledge about the research question by integrating sentiment analysis into price prediction, an aspect that has not been extensively explored in previous studies. The combination of quantitative and qualitative features in the model provides a more holistic view of the rental market, which could lead to a better understanding of the factors influencing pricing. This research has attempted to improve and complement the experimental methods in the literature by focusing on a variety of feature selection techniques, implementing neural networks, and leveraging customer opinions through sentiment analysis.

To advance this research question, it would be valuable to consider first, conducting case studies in different cities could provide a deeper understanding of how the factors that influence Airbnb pricing vary. Second, implementing a real-time feedback system that allows owners to adjust their prices based on market trends and consumer insights could be a significant step forward. Although the research employed TextBlob to score emotions, more sophisticated natural language processing (NLP) models, such as BERT or RoBERta, could pick up more precise details in customer feedback. This approach would not only benefit owners by increasing their profits, but would also improve the consumer experience by offering fairer and more competitive pricing.

To conclude, although setting the rental price of an Airbnb is challenging, the research makes considerable progress in understanding the elements that go into price determination. What is revolutionary about the article is the combination of machine learning and emotion analysis, which is an innovative and effective approach, providing a valuable tool for both owners and users in fairly assessing the value of properties.
